                                                Project Topic: Census Analysis Machine Learning Model
Introduction: 

The project aims to develop a machine learning model for analyzing census data. The model will utilize historical data from 2005 to 2022 (excluding 2020) to predict population and industry percentages per state in the US. This predictive model will assist individuals in making informed decisions about their career location based on factors such as income, sex, and class of worker.

Theories and Applications:

1.	Career Location Decision-making: The model could help individuals decide where to move for their career based on factors such as salary and industry competitiveness in different states.
2.	Salaries and Industry Competitiveness: Individuals may use this model to evaluate the salaries and the number of people in the industry in a state to determine if it offers a competitive environment.

Industry List:

•	Agriculture
•	Construction
•	Manufacturing
•	Wholesale
•	Retail
•	Transportation
•	Information
•	Finance and Real Estate
•	Professional, scientific, and management, and administrative and waste management services
•	Education and Health
•	Arts, Entertainment, and Food
•	Others, except public administration
•	Public Administration

Metrics:

•	Income
•	Sex
•	Class of workers
•	Employee of private company workers
•	Self-employed in own incorporated business workers
•	Private not-for-profit wage and salary workers
•	Local, state, and federal government workers
•	Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers and unpaid family workers


Tools Used:

•	Python: Used for data preprocessing, model implementation, and optimization.
•	pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
•	Scikitlearn or sklearn: Used for implementing machine learning models and optimization techniques.
•	Tableau: Used for visualizing the data and model performance.

Top 3 Industry by Income , Sex and Class of Worker:

•	Public Administration
•	Finance and Insurance,Real Estate, Rental, and Leasing
•	Information

Data Sources: 
The data for this project comes from the Census Bureau, providing comprehensive and reliable information on population and industry percentages per state in the US.

Data Analysis: 
Python is used for data cleaning, normalization, and standardization prior to modeling. 

Model Development:
1.	Predictive Model: We developed a supervised regression model using scikit-learn or a similar library to predict population and industry percentages per state.
2.	Linear Regression: The model will utilize linear regression, a type of supervised learning, to predict population and industry percentages.

Model Optimization: 
The optimization process is documented, including iterative changes made to the model and their impact on performance, in a CSV format using Python script.

Conclusion:
The project aims to provide a valuable tool for individuals seeking to make informed decisions about their career location. By analyzing historical data, we can offer insights into population and industry trends per state, aiding individuals in choosing the most suitable location for their career goals.
