# Census Analysis Machine Learning Model

In this model we are building on top of the previous data that we had used for our project 3.
This model is going all the way back to 2014 (minus 2020 as there were some errors with the pathing).
With this data we are trying to have it predict the population and the industry percentages per state.

# Theories behind the use for this

This model could be used to help those that are possibly looking for where to go for their career or where to not go, depending on the data that they want to use.
If the person wants to move to an area due to the salaries, or the amount of people in the industry in the state to either be in a competive environment or a not.
